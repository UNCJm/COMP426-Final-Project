# COMP426-Final-Project
Our final project is a Hangman game with a few (a lot of) twists.
It is recommended that you open "hangman_frontend/tutorial.html" to know about the rules and how to set the game up.
We utilized sqlite to save user information (names and high scores) and used Wordnik's public dictionary API to curate words for the Hangman game.
(Thanks to KMP for the $5, I actually did spend $5 to buy the API key.)
